There's a repeating pattern I see in many React projects: a narrowly purposed
component gradually grows into a multi-headed monster doing too many things.
Such example of a "noisy" component state could be as simple as keeping numerous
flags for floating elements and feedback indicators:

```jsx
const SomeComponent = () => {
    const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
    const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);
    const data = useFetchData(...);

    const submitSomeData = () => {
        setIsLoading(true);
        ...
        setIsSuccess(true);
    };

    <div>
        {data.map(...)}
        <button
          onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}
          disabled={isLoading}
        >
          {isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Add'}
        </button>

        <Modal open={modalOpen} onSubmit={submitSomeData} ... />
        <Toast open={isSuccess} ... />
    </div>
}
```

A component which usually starts with just data fetching gradually
starts dealing with mutations, forms inside modals, their open/close state,
then come the loaders, the feedback indicators and so on.

We can tidy things up significantly by colocating UI and mutations into a single custom hook -
it's something people don't always realize - nothing stops us from returning
JSX from a hook. Then we just expose some UI and a function to bring it up 
(which is the reason we're not just extracting a component but a hook). 

```jsx

const useSubmitModal = () => {
    const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
    const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);

    const submitSomeData = () => {
        setIsLoading(true);
        ...
        setIsSuccess(true);
        setIsOpen(false);
    };

    return {
        UI: (
          <>
             <Modal open={isOpen}>
             <Toast open={isSuccess} />
          </>
        ),
        open: () => setIsOpen(true),
        isLoading,
        isSuccess,
    }
}
```

Suddenly we're back to being tidy and concerns are better separated - mutations,
their UI and feedback live together and we can even reuse them. Consumer
components decide when to bring up the UI but don't need to keep any open/close
state - it has become an implementation detail of the hook itself:

```jsx

const SomeComponent = () => {
    const data = useFetchData(...);
    const { UI, isLoading, open, ... } = useSubmitModal();

    <div>
        {data.map(...)}
        ....
        <button
          onClick={open}
          disabled={isLoading}
        >
           {isLoading ? 'Loading...' : 'Edit'}
        </button>

        {UI}
    </div>
}

```

This approach can have long term implications and even prevent bugs - a minor
mistake I often see is keeping modal state in some sort of global store where
toggling it becomes a much more imperative hassle - it's easier to forget to clean
up in certain situations. We have to remember to do yet one more thing, in multiple 
places. 


--> Now compare it to our solution which practically self cleans - the
toggle state is local and goes away when the hook unmounts along with the component
using it.
