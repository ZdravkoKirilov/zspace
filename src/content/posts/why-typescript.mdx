I started my career writing pure JavaScript for complex and non-trivial apps and
at the time I just thought of it as "normal" - something that nowadays I would
describe as "pure misery".

I first stumbled upon TypeScript because of Angular 2. And it felt exhilarating,
I just didn't realize for a while that the joy was coming from the language and not
so much the framework. Nowadays I couldn't imagine doing any half serious work on an untyped language regardless of libraries, frameworks or runtimes.

The "Hello world" of TypeScript is an example of adding two numbers:

```ts
function addNumbers(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}

addNumbers(1, "a chicken"); // boom
```

Works well as a start point, but there are other benefits like:

- intelisense
- more "works on the first run" occurences
- describing business logic and states

Let's go into more detail about the last one. Imagine we're building a very simple
applicant tracking system, where we have the following data model:

```ts
type JobApplication = {
    state: string;
    email: string;
    name: string

    job_title: string;
    skills: string[];
    ... etc
}
```

A developer hops in and tries to display a list of the candidate's skills before
the application is submitted:

```jsx
jobApp.skills.map((skill) => <span>{skill}</span>);
```

.. and boom - we run into the "`cannot access property of undefined`" error. Sadly
what I see people do is reaching for optional fields:

```ts
type JobApplication = {
    state: string;
    email: string;
    name: string

    job_title?: string;
    skills?: string[];
    ... etc
}
```

It's lazy and sloppy, it basically lies half the time and leads to situations
like the following: a new front-end developer has just joined the company.
We're rebuilding the screen where we display submitted job applications. She takes
a look at the types and figures that the job application might be lacking the
"skills" field:

```jsx
if (!jobApp.skills) {
  return <div>No skills.</div>;
}
```

But a plain div is not up to standards in our company, let's reach to a designer
and see what we should display instead. Now at this point the designer may or may
not point out to us that if we're looking at the "submitted job applications"
screen then we'll for sure have at least 3 skills listed, because that's how
we roll.

Let's imagine we wasted the designer's time thinking on how to tackle
this UI and we open a pull request. An all-knowing founding engineer looks at
the code and points the impossible situation to us. We're wasting more company
time.

How much easier would it be if we wrote such code:

```ts

type DraftJobApplication = {
    state: "draft";
    email: string;
    name: string

    job_title?: string;
    skills?: string[];
    ... etc
}

type SubmittedJobApplication = {
    state: "submitted";
    email: string;
    name: string

    job_title: string;
    skills: string[];
    ... etc
}

function submit(jobApp: DraftJobApplication): SubmittedJobApplication {
    ...
}

```

Projects that describe business logic as a collection of states and the valid
operations we can do on them require some time to setup but in my experience
pay that off tenfold. Not just in company time, but also in developer happiness.
That new recruit would've probably understood all she had to from the code itself
without having to message people or feel awkward during the code review.
Domain knowledge isn't blackboxed inside the founding engineers' heads - instead
we have a living documentation right where we need it.

I see types as the tool to achieve that. It goes way beyond summing two numbers
or "protecting you from bugs".

In a follow-up post I'll improve the typed example even more and explain why
and how to achieve even better describe-ability with custom types:

```ts

type DraftJobApplication = {
    state: "draft";
    email: Email;
    name: StringOfLength<1, 50>;

    job_title?: StringOfLength<2, 50>;
    skills?: ArrayOfLength<string, 0, 20>;
    ... etc
}

type SubmittedJobApplication = {
    state: "submitted";
    email: Email;
    name: StringOfLength<1, 50>;

    job_title: StringOfLength<2, 50>;
    skills: ArrayOfLength<string, 3, 20>;;
    ... etc
}

```
