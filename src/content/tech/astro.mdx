I really like Astro - so far for my purposes it provides a definitely smoother
developer experience than Next or Remix. Great docs, the dev server is blazingly
fast, no unexpected bugs or crashes, styling is very simple and works out of
the box.

Content collections are an awesome abstraction as well. My only critique would
be the lack of named exports whereas I can't hit "find all references" on a 
component but have to rely on text-based search.

Building the current website with it is a breeze and quite fun. I hope that at
some point I will be able to sprinkle in some interactivity with Qwik, e.g. -
search functionality. Then I'll also have an opinion on how integrations work,
MDX was painless so far and is what I use for all content, including what you're
reading right now.
