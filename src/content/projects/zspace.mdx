Back in 2023 the company I was working for, my overall favorite one of all time
was shutting down. The business has just been slowly dying for years - I joined
a 30 people team only to remain in the final 5. I stayed loyal until the end but
the new owners didn't care much. I had to leave with a few unpaid salaries, without
the right of parental leave, with our first newborn baby and in the worst IT market
ever. Yaks. 

Initially I didn't wholy grasp how bad the job market was - I even took the liberty
to rest between jobs. Then the nightmare ensued. In just a few weeks I was rejected
just on the CV stage more times than in my entire career. Whenever I reached an interview
it was either with a recruiter asking things like 

> How many years of React experience?
> Good, and how many of Next.js?

I was trying to explain that one largely overlaps with the other and a person with
9+ years of experience wouldn't bulge transitioning, but it felt.. mute. I've had
a few long cycles of interviews only to be disappointed at the end, I also failed
a few automated test challenges and I was starting to get a bit concerned looking
at the family savings.

The "tell me about yourself" question doesn't feel that different whether you're
starting out your career or have long experience under your belt. In the first case
you're panicking on what to actually say, while in the latter you're also panicking
on what to pick from the many things you can say. I always felt uneasy after
an interview round: did I manage to say exactly who I am? Did I pick the right
thing to emphasyze in front of that particular person or company? A CV or a LinkedIn
profile just can't tell the full story of a person, interviews to some extent can
(that also depends on the person in front of you - many of them shouldn't be given
the responsibility they have) but often times we assume we're telling more than
we actually are. Details are slipping between the lines and we miss important
points. I guess that's inevitable.

But I kept thinking how can I mitigate this factor? How can I make sure I would
never be in such a painful situation again? How can I convey the truth - that I
literally breathe programming and I'll be valuable to any company?

The answer I came with can be summarized to something like "you are what you build".
I've been building non-public apps for my entire career, there's not much to show
beyond the largely abundant "React Node TypeScript full stack" trope and a "trust
me - I'm special" narrative.

That's how this website came to be! I knew I wanted to build something
beyond a generic business card type of website. I needed my own space where I can
actually tell my story, how I got here and where I'm going.




One of the things I enjoy the most doing is taking a real world concept and translating
it into a virtual one. This process starts off with what I call "entities" or OOP
people - classes. I thought a lot about this, what I just couldn't tell on a CV
or LinkedIn, I knew I wanted to create something more structured, where different
aspects of my technical being click together.






I picked Astro with great
enthusiasm since such content sites are exactly what it's made for. And I'm
really glad with the decision - it's awesome.

I even did a little bit of design stuff with Canva (great software if you don't
need a bazooka) and I must say I don't hate it. Tailwind has been a breeze as
well, I sprinkled in a few custom classes in the config and took off building
actual stuff pretty quickly.

Astro content collections feel great, with zod and everything, you can kind of
simulate a similar behaviour manually, but it probably won't be as performant
and we should be trying to stay idiomatic with the framework anyway.
