This is the website you're currently looking at! I picked Astro with great
enthusiasm since such content sites are exactly what it's made for. And I'm
really glad with the decision - it's awesome.

I even did a little bit of design stuff with Canva (great software if you don't
need a bazooka) and I must say I don't hate it. Tailwind has been a breeze as
well, I sprinkled in a few custom classes in the config and took off building
actual stuff pretty quickly.

Astro content collections feel great, with zod and everything, you can kind of
simulate a similar behaviour manually, but it probably won't be as performant
and we should be trying to stay idiomatic with the framework anyway.
