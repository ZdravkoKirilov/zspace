<p>
  Hey I'm Zdravko - a software engineer from Bulgaria with a TypeScript
  and front-end/React emphasis.

  In general terms I would probably fall into the <a className="text-primary underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills" target="_blank">"T-shaped"</a> pattern -
  I keep expanding my broader web knowledge while maintaining a deeper expertise
  on the front end.

  <br />

  I believe that my most important traits are <span className="italic text-primary">tidiness</span>, <span className="italic text-primary">emphathy</span> and <span className="italic text-primary">creativity</span>.

  <br />

  You can learn about my expertise <a className="text-primary underline" href="/craft">here.</a> or see more

<p className="pl-8">I'm self taught, my formal education is in history and I've
enjoyed it quite a lot - it's still a hobby of mine and I believe it helps me
better understand the world and how it functions.</p>

<br />
<p className="pl-8">Programming came at a slightly later stage but quickly became my bigget
passion. I'm a creative person and it gave me the right amount of freedom and
sense of fulfilment.</p>
