<p>
  Hey I'm Zdravko - a software engineer from Bulgaria with a TypeScript
  and front-end/React emphasis.

  In general terms I would probably fall into the <a className="text-primary underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills" target="_blank">"T-shaped"</a> pattern -
  I keep expanding my broader web knowledge while maintaining a deeper expertise
  on the front end.

  <br />
  Some of my broader skills include:

  - UI/UX/Accessibility literacy
  - Working within product teams and knowing how to build products, not just writing code
  - Interviewing and mentoring experience

  <br />



  You can find more technical details <a className="text-primary underline" href="/craft">here.</a>

  ### I believe that my most important traits are <span className="italic text-primary">tidiness</span>, <span className="italic text-primary">emphathy</span> and <span className="italic text-primary">creativity</span>.

- I'm self taught, my formal education is in history

- Programming came at a slightly later stage but quickly became my bigget
passion

- I used to be a semi-professional Warcraft 3 player

- I worked at a board game shop focused on Magic the Gathering

- I used to sustain myself with online poker back in college

- I care deeply about stray animals (a problem in Bulgaria) and help as much as I can

- I love reading/listening to books, especially fantasy

- If I had more time I would like to learn to draw, play the guitar, write a fantasy book, create board games (I've done a bit here already)
