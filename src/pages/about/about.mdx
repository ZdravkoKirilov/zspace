Hey I'm Zdravko - a software engineer from Bulgaria with a TypeScript
and front-end/React emphasis.

In general terms I would probably fall into the <a className="text-primary underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills" target="_blank">"T-shaped"</a> pattern -
I keep expanding my full-stack web knowledge while maintaining a deeper expertise
on the front end.

<br />
### Some of my broader skills include:

- UI/UX/Accessibility literacy
- Interviewing and mentoring experience
- Adaptability, balancing quality with speed
- Delivering products within cross-functional teams
- For much more detail check <a className="text-primary underline" href="/craft">here.</a>

<br />

### I believe that my most important personal traits are <span className="italic text-primary">tidiness</span>, <span className="italic text-primary">emphathy</span> and <span className="italic text-primary">creativity</span>.

- I'm self taught, my formal education is in history

- Programming quickly became my bigget passion - I have more side projects than I can handle

- I'm happily married, we have 1 child

- People say I can cook :)

- I used to be a semi-professional Warcraft 3 player

- I worked at a board game shop focused on Magic the Gathering

- I used to play a lot of online poker back in college

- I care deeply about stray animals (a severe problem in Bulgaria) and help as much as I can

- I love reading/listening to books, especially fantasy

- If I have more time I would like to learn to draw, play the guitar, write a fantasy book, create board games (I've started with some)
