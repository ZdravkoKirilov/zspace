Hey I'm Zdravko - a software engineer from Bulgaria with a TypeScript
and front-end/React emphasis.

In general terms I would probably fall into the <a className="text-primary underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills" target="_blank">"T-shaped"</a> pattern -
I keep expanding my full-stack web knowledge while maintaining a deeper expertise
on the front end.

<br />
## Instead of an essay: here are few "top-3" things:

<br />

### What makes me "special"?

- I can actually build products from start to finish, including even (modest) UI/UX design
- I know the right balance between under and over-engineering depending on circumstances
- I realize that coding is only half the work - one also needs to understand the business domain

### What in my opinion keeps a project tidy?

- Good types
- Knowing when to break down complexity
- Being consistent

### What are my most important personal traits?

- empathy
- creativity
- curiosity to learn

- I'm self taught, my formal education is in history 📜

- Programming quickly became my biggest passion - I have more side projects than I can handle

- I'm happily married, we have 1 child

- People say I can cook 👨‍🍳

- I used to be a semi-professional Warcraft 3 player

- I worked at a board game shop focused on Magic the Gathering 🎲

- I used to play a lot of online poker back in college

- I care deeply about stray animals (a severe problem in Bulgaria) and help as much as I can 😼

- I love reading/listening to books, especially fantasy

- If I have more time I would like to learn to draw, play the guitar, write a fantasy book, create board games (I've started with some)
